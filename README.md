## 🧠 About Me

```ts
const aakash = {
  role: "Conversational AI Engineer",
  focus: ["LLMs", "NLP", "RAG", "Scalable Backends"],
  mindset: "Ship clean systems that survive production",
  location: "Bengaluru, India"
}
```

I design enterprise-grade conversational AI systems and full-stack platforms that blend LLMs, cloud infrastructure, and modern web engineering.

I enjoy breaking complex systems into understandable parts, making AI behave responsibly in production, and turning scary codebases into boring, reliable ones.
