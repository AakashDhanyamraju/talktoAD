# 👋 Hey, I’m Aakash

I’m a full-stack developer and AI engineer who likes building things that actually work in the real world.

Most of my time goes into conversational AI, backend systems, and figuring out how to make LLMs useful without turning everything into a science experiment. I enjoy cleaning up messy codebases, designing systems that scale calmly, and shipping features that don’t cause surprise outages.

I’m not here to reinvent the wheel — just to make it roll smoother.

## 🧠 What I work on

- Conversational AI & chatbots  
- LLM-powered workflows (RAG, prompt engineering, MCP)  
- Backend services with Node.js  
- Cloud infrastructure on AWS  
- Frontend apps with React & Next.js  

Basically: glue code, logic, and systems that hold together under pressure.

## 💼 Experience

### Avaamo Technologies — Conversational AI Developer
I build and maintain enterprise chatbots used by real users at scale.  
That includes backend logic, integrations, cloud deployments, and a lot of “why is this behaving like that?” debugging.

I’ve worked on systems used by companies like Mondelēz, Wipro, Intel, and UCHealth, and I’m usually the person people ping when something complex needs to be simplified.

## 🚀 Projects

### 🏠 Pick-A-Pad AI
An AI-powered tenant screening platform.

Uses LLMs to parse messy data, analyze risk patterns, and integrate with credit bureau APIs. Comes with an admin dashboard, role-based access, and audit trails — built to be boringly reliable.

### 💬 Real-Time Chat App
A full-stack chat app with real-time messaging, OAuth login, file uploads, voice messages, and admin controls.

Built with React and Firebase, focused on responsiveness and clean state management.
