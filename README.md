I’m a full-stack developer and AI engineer focused on building **production-ready systems**.

Most of my work revolves around conversational AI, backend services, and LLM-powered workflows. I care a lot about maintainability, scalability, and making sure systems behave predictably once they hit real users.

I enjoy simplifying complex systems and shipping software that holds up under pressure.
